# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

## Project Overview

The **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** project focuses on analyzing employee attrition (employee turnover) and predicting factors contributing to it using historical HR data. The project aims to help organizations predict employee attrition and assess performance, enabling HR departments to take proactive measures to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## Key Objectives

- **Predict Employee Attrition**: Build a model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on their work characteristics and personal information.
- **Understand Factors Influencing Attrition**: Identify the most significant factors that contribute to employee attrition.
- **Analyze Employee Performance**: Assess employee performance based on metrics like job satisfaction, performance ratings, and years at the company.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer recommendations to HR managers for improving retention strategies and employee satisfaction.

## Dataset

This project uses the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset, which contains features such as:
- Employee satisfaction
- Job role
- Gender
- Age
- Marital status
- Years at the company
- Salary
- Performance rating

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for creating and testing the project.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Collection**: Gather HR-related data, including employee satisfaction, job role, gender, age, marital status, salary, and other features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to discover patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that improve the modelâ€™s performance.
5. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict employee attrition and assess performance.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Deployment (Optional)**: Deploy the model using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
